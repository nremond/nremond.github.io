It's now almost two years since we came back from our trip around the world. Given the duration of the trip, I didn't took so many photographs but still, there was about 60 rolls to develop, to scan and to go thru. So yes, it took me two years to process that but I'm quite thrilled to be able to share some exciting memory of that trip with you now.

The engineers at Instagram put forward a challenge for coders to unshred this chopped up image. See the original post on their engineering blog : "Instagram Engineering Challenge: The Unshredder.":http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/12651721845/instagram-engineering-challenge-the-unshredder

h3. The problem

Here are the input and target output images:

h5. The shredded version

I wrote a solution in Python that resolves the problem; here is the basic idea of the algorithm :
# define a correlation function for two pixel columns
# start with a random shred
# find the shred with the maximum correlation value that would fit on the left hand side or on the right hand side of the reconstructed picture
# iterate until all the shreds have been used

The bonus question was to guess how wide the uniform shreds are. I proceeded this way :
# Consider all shreds width that can divide the image correctly
# Compute the difference score between all shreds - it's the opposite of the correlation score used before and I also include a ratio of the shred_width
# When we are on a edge between two sherds, the difference is at its maximum. So, take the maximum of all computed difference scores.
